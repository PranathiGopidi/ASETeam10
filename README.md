# PLANOVAC  
(A Online Scheduler Application only for Students)   
  
  
**Abstract:**  
In the scenario of vast set of people, students are the main focused study group who needs to meet the deadlines without fail. Many people have the remainder, notification applications to remaind if they miss the scheduled dates. 
  
What if students skip their deadlines ?
 - Their grades go down, 
 - Re-registering the course,
 - Redoing the work,
 - Need to spend lots of money etc. etc.      
   
In order to deal with such issues, our application makes on making the application which portraits the problems faced by students and gives the simple solution called the PLANOVAC which means Scheduler in Czech Language.   
  
# Specific Features  
**Feature 1 - Profile**  
Profile is the basic feature of any application which showcases the user account details of the login user. This provides the information of the user when logged in from gmail. The profile informations are stored in Mongo Database.  
**Feature 2 - Classes**  
Planovac gives the student an opportunity to store their class schedule, so that they get notifications time to time to maintain their schedules well. The schedules are given stored in Mongo Database which is interlinked with Google calendar to access the events.
