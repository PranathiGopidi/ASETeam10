# PLANOVAC  
(A Online Scheduler Application only for Students)   
  
  
**Abstract:**  
In the scenario of vast set of people, students are the main focused study group who needs to meet the deadlines without fail. Many people have the remainder, notification applications to remaind if they miss the scheduled dates. 
  
What if students skip their deadlines ?
 - Their grades go down, 
 - Re-registering the course,
 - Redoing the work,
 - Need to spend lots of money etc. etc.      
   
In order to deal with such issues, our application makes on making the application which portraits the problems faced by students and gives the simple solution called the PLANOVAC which means Scheduler in Czech Language.   
  
# Specific Features  
**Feature 1 - Profile**
